## Introduction

CVSS is a tool for creating and editing CVE information in CVE JSON format, and for generating advisories.

The name CVSS is inspired from Greek origin suffix '-gram' which is used for denoting something written or recorded especially in a certain way. Vulnerability related information when recorded in a standard format can help in aggregation, curation, dissemination, analysis and remediation. This enables automation and efficiency in response activities.
